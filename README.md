Tera Bamarama statistical analysis tool. Records match results and displays match history statistics to help predict the result of future matches.  

Made in 2015. This was a rushed project. Login passwords are hardcoded because accounts were not required for my purposes, just varying permission levels.  
Guest (password: guest) and User (password: parku) have all view permissions, but no modify permissions. Admin (password: mrcat) can record, edit and delete fights.

## Background ##
My friends and I were playing an MMORPG called Tera. 
A 2 week long event was introduced called Bamarama, which had monsters fight each other 1v1 in an arena and players could wager in-game currency on the result. 
We quickly noticed some monsters would win more often than others. We also noticed that some monsters were specifically good against other monsters. 
At first, I began recording match results in a Google spreadsheet which would calculate win rates and other basic stats.
These spreadsheets quickly became insufficient as we noticed more trends that we wanted to track. For example, each match had one monster in defense stance and one in attack stance. These stances would cause the monsters to use different abilities more often. Some abilities are better than others, so when certain monsters would fight in a certain stance, they would have a higher win rate than when they fought in the opposite stance. 
It was around this point (almost a week into the event) that I decided to create this BamStats website. It was made in less than 2 days with the intention of being used for only a week, which is why certain hacks were implemented for the sake of quick functionality, like hardcoded passwords. This website made it easier for my friends and I to record match results. It also provided the ability to quickly and cleanly view all match-up statistics in one page.
I gave the guest password to guild members so they could view the match-up statistics without the ability to modify anything.  
This website definitely served its purpose and I am very happy with the results. My friends and I won many wagers and I quadrupled my in-game currency before the event ended.
